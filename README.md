Best provides:
* **Indoor Fire Evacuation system across iOS and Android.** BEST can support iOS and Android, enabling for evacuate people regardelss of what devices they use. 
* **High Accuracy of Indoor localization** BEST use the multi-classification with DNN. The accuracy of the Model is 78%. Also use the algorithm for adjust indoor localization.
* **2D map with cell status and 3D AR navigation system.** BEST display 2D map and 3D AR arrow to navigate the optimal excaping path. The cell in 2D map inform users where the hazards are. User-friendly AR arrow inform users the direction to the exit.
* **Real-Time socket communication and Optimized Route Algorithm.** BEST uses TCP connection for real-time. Q-learning algorithm derives optimal path based on user's location and indoor situation.
    
## Documentation
To get more detail information about BEST, please refer to the [BEST documentation](https://github.com/BeaconAR/BEST/wiki). This describes key novelties on BEST, from what BEST is for, when BEST is useful.

To get more detail information about technology used in BEST, we have written a [series of documentation](https://github.com/BeaconAR/BEST/wiki) that explains how the BEST works, how did we troubleshoot.
